# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

<p style="text-align: justify">
I'm a freelance Software Developer specializing in building and maintaining web apps, with 4+ years of experience.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
As a full-stack developer, I work with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL <em>(and more, depending on your project needs)</em>. Whether it's creating websites from scratch, customizing existing ones, or improving performance â€” I build web applications with efficiency in mind.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I rely on research to guide technical decisions, ensuring the solutions I build are well-suited to the problem â€” as broad as necessary and as simple as possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
If you have a project in mind and think my experience could help, I'm open to discussing how we might work together.
